## Questions and problems

For general questions and issues please join the [GGIR google
group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/RpackageGGIR) and create
a new thread. When you report a problem in this group always try to create a minimalistic example that someone else can use to reproduce and investigate your problem.

However, if you are familiar with GitHub, you are also welcome to report
your issue via the [GitHub issue
tracker](https://github.com/wadpac/GGIR/issues). Please use the message template as displayed.

Note that support in these places is based on voluntary efforts and we
encourage you to try and help other users with questions.

Questions are valuable as they help us understand the challenges you run
into and they occasionally help us to identify a bug in the code. To
make this practical, please AVOID sending your questions through
personal messages. Instead, post them on public platforms. This approach
allows others to benefit from the discussions, minimises the need for us
to respond to the same inquiries repeatedly, enhances the likelihood
that others can answer your questions when we're unavailable, and
acknowledges the volunteer effort invested in responding to queries.
