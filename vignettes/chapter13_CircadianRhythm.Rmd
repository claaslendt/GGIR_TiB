## MXLX

Detection of the continuous least (LX) and most (MX) active X hours in a day, where X
is defined by argument `winhr`. For both GGIR calculates the average
acceleration, the start time, and if argument `iglevels` is specified
also the intensity gradient. If argument `winhr` is a vector then
descriptive values for LX and MX are derived per value in `winhr`.
Within GGIR part 2 MXLX is calculated per calendar day and, if argument
`qwindow` is specified, per segment of the day. Within GGIR part 5 MXLX
is calculated per window, and if used in combination with the GENEActiv or Axivity
accelerometer brand LUX estimates per LX and MX are included.

The MX metric described here should not be confused by the MX metrics as proposed
by [Rowlands et al.](https://doi.org/10.1186/s40798-019-0225-9) which looks at
accumulated most active time which may not always be continuous in time.
The MX metrics by Rowlands et al. are discussed further down.

## Cosinor analysis and Extended Cosinor analysis

The (Extended) Cosinor analysis quantifies the circadian 24 hour cycle.
To do this GGIR uses R package
[ActCR](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ActCR) as a dependency.
Specify argument `cosinor = TRUE` to perform these analysis.

The implementation within GGIR part 2 is as follows:

-   Acceleration values are averaged per minute, and then log
    transformation as `log(acceleration converted to _mg_ + 1)`.
-   Invalid data points such as caused by non-wear are set to missing
    (`NA`) in order to prevent the imputation approach used elsewhere in
    GGIR to influence the Cosinor analysis. We do this because
    imputation technique generally come with some assumptions about
    circadian rhythm.
-   GGIR looks for the first valid data point in the recording and then
    selects the maximum integer number of recording days following this
    data point and feeds these to the ActCosinor and ActExtendCosinor
    functions of ActCR. The time offset between the start and the
    following midnight is then used to reverse offset the ActCR results,
    to ensure that acrophase and acrotime can be interpreted relative to
    midnight.
-   In relation to Day Saving Time: Duplicated time stamps when clock
    moves backward are ignored and missing time stamps when clock moves
    forward are inserted as missing values.
-   Time series corresponding to the fitted models are stored inside the
    part 2 milestone data to facilitate visual inspection. For the
    moment they are not used in any GGIR visualisation, but you may want
    to look them up and try to plot them yourself.

## Intradaily Variability (IV) and Interdaily Stability (IS)

**Disclaimer: This functionality has undergone major revisions and enhancements in 2024. The documentation you find here is outdated and will be updated as soon as the enhancements have been incorporated in a GGIR release.**

### IV and IS - Default

The original implementation (argument `IVIS.activity.metric = 1`) uses the
continuous numeric acceleration values. However, as we later realised,
this is not compatible with the original approach by van Someren and
colleagues, which uses a binary distinction between active and inactive.
Therefore, a second option was added (argument `IVIS.activity.metric = 2`),
which needs to be used in combination with accelerometer metric ENMO,
and collapses the acceleration values into a binary score of rest versus
active. This is the current default.

### IV and IS - Cosinor analysis compatible

IS is sometimes used as a measure of behavioural robustness when
conducting Cosinor analysis. However, to work with the combination of
the two outcomes it seems important that IS is calculated from the same
time series. Therefore, when `cosinor = TRUE` IV and IS are calculated
twice: Once as part of the default IV and IS analysis as discussed
above, and once as part of the Cosinor analysis using the same log
transformed time series. More specifically, the IV and IS algorithm is
applied with `IVIS.activity.metric = 2` and
a threshold `IVIS_acc_threshold = log(20 + 1)` to make the binary distinction
between active and inactive, and `IVIS_per_daypair = TRUE`. The setting
`IVIS_per_daypair` was specifically designed for this context to handle
the potentially missing values in the time series as used for Cosinor
analysis. Applying the default IVIS algorithm would not be able to
handle the missing values and would result in a loss of information if
all non-matching epochs across the entire recording were excluded.
Instead, IV and IS are calculated as follows:

1.  Per day pair based on matching valid epochs only IV and IS and
    calculated. Here, a log is kept of the number of valid epochs per day
    pair.
2.  Omit day pairs where the fraction of valid epoch pairs is below 0.66
    (0.66 is hard-coded at the moment).
3.  Calculate average IS across days weighted by fraction of valid
    epochs per day pairs.

The new Cosinor-compatible IV and IS estimates are stored as output
variables `cosinorIV` and `cosinorIS`.
