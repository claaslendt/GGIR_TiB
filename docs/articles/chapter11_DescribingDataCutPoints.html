<p>Descriptive variables such as average acceleration as discussed in
the previous chapter are powerful indicators of physical activity.
Extensive evidence exists on the association between magnitude of
acceleration as captured by an accelerometer and physical activity
related energy expenditure as measured by indirect calorimetry. The
value of MX metrics and intensity gradient as discussed in chapter 7 has
been shown in several studies (for example: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31318713/" class="external-link">Rowlands, 2019a</a>; <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31808014/" class="external-link">Rowlands 2019b</a>).
However, historically the physical activity research community has been
keen on having a single or a small number of measures of physical
activity that can be expressed in the unit minutes per day.</p>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="construct-definition">Construct definition<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#construct-definition"></a>
</h3>
<p>A popular approach to describe time series data in physical activity
research is to distinguish so called intensity levels. Here, the
community distinguishes sedentary behaviour (SB), light physical
activity (LIPA), moderate, and vigorous physical activity. The latter
two categories are often combined into moderate or vigorous physical
activity (MVPA).</p>
<p>The exact definition of these levels is poor which has caused
methodological discrepancies for decades:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Intensity levels are defined based on metabolic equality of task
(MET), which is based on oxygen consumption measured with indirect
calorimetry divided by body weight. MET as a construct fail to normalise
for body weight by which comparisons of individuals or activity types
that have a different relation with body weight are bound to drive
differences.</p></li>
<li><p>The MET thresholds themselves (e.g. 3 MET) has a different
meaning per person as MET value is not only driven by what people do in
terms of movement but also their fitness and anthropometry.</p></li>
<li><p>Lack of consensus on how to handle the temporal nature of
behaviour. For example, is a few seconds enough to define a behaviour or
do we require minimum time duration?</p></li>
<li><p>Criterion methods are hard to standardise across studies. For
example, the studies differ in specific equipment, study protocols, and
preparation of the data from the criterion method.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="classification-with-accelerometer-data">Classification with accelerometer data<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#classification-with-accelerometer-data"></a>
</h3>
<p>From an accelerometer data processing perspective time spent in
intensity levels is often simplified to time spent below, above, or
between certain acceleration level(s) chosen to make a crude separation
of the intensity levels. The acceleration magnitude(s) to use as
threshold(s), is often referred to as cut-point in the literature.</p>
<p>Time spent below, above, or between the cut-point(s) is intended to
be a crude indicator of time spent in behaviours and sufficient to rank
individuals on their amount of time spent in these behaviours. The
simple threshold approach has indisputably been the most powerful method
so far to drive physical activity research.</p>
<p>In GGIR part 2, only MVPA is estimate. The threshold(s) for MVPA as
used in GGIR part 2 are set with parameter <code>mvpathreshold</code>.
You can specify a single value or a vector of multiple values, time
spent in MVPA will then be derived with each of them. However, the
threshold is not the only parameters to influence time spent in MVPA, as
we will discussed in the following paragraphs.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="role-of-epoch-length">Role of epoch length<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#role-of-epoch-length"></a>
</h3>
<p>Although accelerometers collect data at much higher sampling
frequency, we only work with aggregated values (e.g. 1 or 5 second
epochs) for the following reasons:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Accelerometers are often used to describe patterns in metabolic
energy expenditure. Metabolic energy expenditure is typically defined
per breath or per minute (indirect calorimetry), per day (room
calorimeter), or per multiple days (doubly labelled water method). In
order to evaluate our methods against these reference standards, we need
to work with a similar time resolution.</p></li>
<li><p>Collapsing the data to epoch summary measures helps to
standardise our output across data collected with different sampling
frequencies between studies.</p></li>
<li><p>There is little evidence that the raw data is an accurate
representation of body acceleration. All scientific evidence on the
validity of accelerometer data has so far been based on epoch
aggregates.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Short epoch lengths, such as 1 or 5 seconds, are more sensitive to
sporadic behaviours and often combined with bout detection to identify
MVPA only as a sustained behaviour.</p>
<p>Longer epochs, such as 30 or 60 seconds, do not have this problem and
are therefore easier to use without bout detection.</p>
<p>The epoch length in GGIR is by default 5 seconds, and can be set as
the first value of the vector specified by parameter
<code>windowsizes</code>. Although we discuss epoch length here in the
context of MVPA, please note that epoch length influences many of the
outcomes by GGIR.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="bout-detection">Bout detection<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#bout-detection"></a>
</h3>
<p>A bout is a time segment that meets specific temporal criteria and
has frequently been used in the physical activity research. GGIR
facilitates processing data both with and without accounting for bouts.
The motivation to look for bouts can be one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>With the idea that only behaviour with a certain minimum duration
contributes to certain physiological benefits.</p></li>
<li><p>To make the classification of behaviour consistent with
self-report data, only sensitive to duration of specific
duration.</p></li>
<li><p>To aid studying the fragmentation of behaviour.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To define a bout we need to answer series of question:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What should the cut-point be?</li>
<li>What should the epoch length be?</li>
<li>What should minimum duration of bout be?</li>
<li>Should we allow for gaps in a bout as in breaks in the behaviour of
interest?</li>
<li>If yes to 4, should this be a percentage of the bout duration, an
absolute minimum in seconds, or a combination of both?</li>
<li>If yes to 4, are bout gaps counted towards the time spent in
bouts?</li>
<li>Do the first and last epoch need to meet the threshold
criteria?</li>
<li>In what order are the bouts extracted? For example, if a short MVPA
bout is part of a longer Inactivity bout which of the two prevails?</li>
<li>How many bout categories should there be?</li>
</ol>
<p>GGIR facilitates the following freedom in bout detection:</p>
<p>User decides on:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Acceleration thresholds for light, moderate, and vigorous
intensity</p></li>
<li><p>Fraction of time for which cut-point criteria need to be met
(light, inactive, MVPA)</p></li>
<li><p>Bout duration range. For example, a simple scenario could be to
consider all bouts of a minimum length of 10 minutes, while it is also
possible to subdivide them in bouts lasting [1, 5) [5, 10) and [10, ∞)
minutes.</p></li>
<li><p>Epoch length.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>User does NOT decide on:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Maximum bout gap of 1 minute, if the fraction of time for which
the cut-point criteria need to be met is less than 100%</p></li>
<li><p>First and last epoch need to meet cut-point criteria.</p></li>
<li><p>Number of intensity levels, which are always: inactive, light and
MVPA.</p></li>
<li><p>Order in which bouts are calculated (1 MVPA; 2 inactive; 3
Light)</p></li>
</ul>
</div>

</h3>
<p>The parameters needed for MVPA estimates in GGIR part 2 are different
from the parameters used for estimating MVPA, LIPA and Inactivity in
part 5.</p>
<p>GGIR part 2 always provides six distinct approaches to MVPA
calculation that are controlled with parameters
<code>mvpathreshold</code>, <code>boutcriter</code>,
<code>mvpadur</code>, and the first element of vector
<code>windowsdur</code>. Here, MVPA provides time spent in MVPA based
on:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>5 second, 1 minute or 5 minute epochs and no bouts</p></li>
<li><p>5 second epochs and 3 different minimum bout duration as
specified with parameter <code>mvpadur</code>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The bout durations are each used for separate estimates and not used
complimentary to each other as is the case in part 5. For example,
specifying <code>boutdur.mod = c(5, 10)</code> in part 5 will result in
an estimate of time spent in bouts lasting from 5 till 10 minutes and in
bouts lasting 10 minutes and longer.</p>

<p>As discussed in chapter 7, it is possible to tell both GGIR part 2
and part 5 to extract variables per segment of the day. We do this with
parameter <code>qwindow</code> for which you can find a detailed
discussion in Annex Day segment analysis.</p>

<h2 id="behavioural-fragmentation">Behavioural fragmentation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#behavioural-fragmentation"></a>

<p>In addition to classifying the time spent in each behavioural class
it is also informative to study the fragmentation of behaviours.</p>

</h3>
<p>In GGIR, a fragment for daytime is a defined as a sequence of epochs
that belong to one of the four categories:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Inactivity</li>
<li>Light Physical Activity (LIPA)</li>
<li>Moderate or Vigorous Physical Acitivty (MVPA)</li>
<li>Physical activity (can be either LIPA or MVPA)</li>
</ol>
<p>Each of these categories represents the combination of bouted and
unbouted time in the respective categories. Inactivity and physical
activity add up to a full day (outside SPT), as well as inactivity, LIPA
and MVPA. The fragmentation metrics are applied in function
<code>g.fragmentation</code>.</p>
<p>A fragment of SPT is defined as a sequence of epochs that belong to
one of the four categories:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Estimated sleep</li>
<li>Estimated wakefulness</li>
<li>Inactivity</li>
<li>Physical activity (can be either LIPA or MVPA)</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that from the metrics below only fragmentation metrics
<code>TP</code> and <code>NFrag</code> are calculated for the SPT
fragments.</p>
<p>With parameter <code>frag.metrics = "all"</code> we can tell GGIR
part 5 to derive behavioural fragmentation metrics for daytime and
(separately) for spt. You may want to consider combining this with
parameter <code>part5_agg2_60seconds=TRUE</code> as that will aggregate
the time series to 1 minute resolution as is common in behavioural
fragmentation literature.</p>

<h3 id="fragmentation-metrics">Fragmentation metrics<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#fragmentation-metrics"></a>
</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Coefficient of Variance (<code>CoV</code>) is calculated
according to <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apmr.2014.08.023" class="external-link">Blikman et
al. 2014</a>, which entails dividing the standard deviation by the mean
lognormal transformed fragment length (minutes).</p></li>
<li><p>Transition probability (<code>TP</code>) from Inactivity (IN) to
Physical activity (IN2PA), from Physical activity to inactivity (PA2IN),
and from IN to LIPA or MVPA are all calculated according to Danilevicz
et al. 2023 10.21203/rs.3.rs-3543711/v1.</p></li>
<li><p>Gini index is calculated with function <code>Gini</code> from the
<code>ineq</code> R package, and with <code>ineq</code> argument
<code>corr</code> set to TRUE.</p></li>
<li><p>Power law exponent metrics: Alpha, x0.5, and W0.5 are calculated
according to <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gaitpost.2009.09.002" class="external-link">Chastin et
al. 2010</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Number of fragment per minutes (<code>NFragPM</code>) is
calculated identical to metric <code>fragmentation index</code> in <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ageing/article/41/1/111/46538" class="external-link">Chastin et
al. 2012</a>, but it is renamed here to be a more specific reflection of
the calculation. The term <code>fragmentation index</code> appears too
generic given that all fragmentation metrics inform us about
fragmentation. Please note that this is close to the metrics for
transition probability, because total number divided by total sum in
duration equals 1 divided by average duration. Although the exact math
is slightly different.</p></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="conditions-for-calculation-and-value-when-condition-is-not-met">Conditions for calculation and value when condition is not met<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#conditions-for-calculation-and-value-when-condition-is-not-met"></a>
</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Metrics <code>Gini</code> and <code>CoV</code> are only
calculated if there are at least 10 fragments (e.g. 5 inactive and 5
active). If this condition is not met the metric value will be set to
missing.</p></li>
<li><p>Metrics related to power law exponent alpha are also only
calculated when there are at least 10 fragments, but with the additional
condition that the standard deviation in fragment duration is not zero.
If these conditions are not met the metric value will be set to
missing.</p></li>
<li><p>Other metrics related to binary fragmentation
(<code>mean_dur_PA</code> and <code>mean_dur_IN</code>), are calculated
when there are at least 2 fragments (1 inactive, 1 active). If this
condition is not met the value will is set to zero.</p></li>
<li><p>Metrics related to <code>TP</code> are calculated if: There is at
least 1 inactivity fragment AND (1 LIPA OR 1 MVPA fragment). If this
condition is not met the <code>TP</code> metric value is set to
zero.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To keep an overview of which recording days met the criteria for
non-zero standard deviation and at least ten fragments, GGIR part 5
stores variable <code>Nvaliddays_AL10F</code> at person level (i.e.,
number of valid days with at least 10 fragments), and
<code>SD_dur</code> (i.e., standard deviation of fragment durations) at
day level as well as aggregated per person.</p>
<ul>
<li>GGIR derives fragmentation metrics per waking hours of the day in
part 5 and per recording in part 6. Calculation per day allows us to
explore and possibly account for behavioural differences between days of
the week. However, for rare behaviours a day level estimate could be
considered less robust than the recording level estimates as generated
in part 6.</li>
