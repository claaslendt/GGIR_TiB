<p>Data quality assurance is at the core of GGIR. GGIR undertakes
several key tasks aimed at evaluating, where possible enhancing the
quality of the data, and documenting how data was enhanced. These tasks
include time gap identification and imputation, automatic calibration of
the sensors, identification of periods when sensors were not worn , and
scrutiny for segments of the signal exhibiting sustained, unusually high
accelerations that are rarely encountered in real-world scenarios.</p>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="time-gaps-identification-and-imputation">Time gaps identification and imputation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#time-gaps-identification-and-imputation"></a>
</h2>
<p>The time gap identification and imputation functionality offered by
GGIR is exclusive to ActiGraph gt3x files, Axivity cwa files, and ad-hoc
csv files. This is because there are potential time gaps in these file
formats. GGIR has been developed to efficiently identify and manage
these time gaps.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="time-gaps-in-axivity-cwa-files">Time gaps in Axivity cwa files<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#time-gaps-in-axivity-cwa-files"></a>
</h3>
<p>Although this is not expected to occur often, Axivity cwa data can
come with faulty data blocks. In Axivity cwa files, a data block
represents a few seconds of data. For example, faulty blocks may occur
when the device is connected to a computer with a USB cable. To address
this, R package <code>GGIRread</code>, which is used by GGIR to read cwa
files, identifies these faulty blocks and imputes them by the last
recorded non-faulty acceleration value normalised to 1 g.</p>
<p>Axivity devices are expected by design to have a slightly variable
sampling rate, which is accounted for by resampling the data. The
interpolation technique used for resampling is set by parameter
<code>interpolationType</code>, and uses linear interpolation by default
(<code>interpolationType = 1</code>) but you can also set it to nearest
neighbour interpolation (<code>interpolationType = 2</code>). As a
quality assurance, <code>GGIRread</code> keeps track of the variation in
sampling rate per data block and automatically imputes blocks where the
sampling rate deviates by more than 10% from the expected sampling rate.
If you are unhappy with this threshold then note that you can change
this percentage with parameter <code>frequency_tol</code>. Biased
sampling rates of this kind are expected to be extremely rare, but we
nonetheless like to be able to account for them.</p>
<p>Additionally, to monitor this process, <code>GGIRread</code> logs a
series of file health statistics which are stored by GGIR in the
‘data_quality_report.csv’ file located within the ‘QC’ folder of the
output directory ‘results’. Within this file, variable names prefixed
with ‘filehealth’, detailing the number and duration of time gaps
detected during recording, as well as number of epochs with 5-10% and
more than 10% biases in the sampling rate.</p>

</h3>
<p>Some manufacturers incorporate functionalities in their devices to
let them stop recording during long episode of no movement, aiming to
conserve battery life and reduce data size. However, this feature
results in recorded signals containing intermittent time gaps that must
be accounted for during data processing.</p>
<p>For example, ActiGraph has the option called idle sleep mode in their
devices, which makes data collection pause when there is no movement for
a sustained period of time. The ActiGraph’s idle sleep mode is <a href="https://actigraphcorp.my.site.com/support/s/article/Idle-Sleep-Mode-Explained" class="external-link">explained</a>
in the manufacturer’s website.</p>
<p>GGIR imputes gaps shorter than 90 minutes at raw data level, using
the last known recorded value normalised to 1 g. While gaps longer than
90 minutes are imputed at epoch level to make the data processing more
memory efficient and faster. These time gaps in the data are considered
non-wear time in GGIR, this implies that we trust the accelerometer to
only cause timegaps when it is not worn, although there is always a risk
of sleep/sedentary misclassification. GGIR logs the number and duration
of the time gaps found in the ‘data_quality_report.csv’ file located
within the ‘QC’ folder of the output directory ‘results’.</p>
<p>Studies often forget to clarify whether the accelerometers were
configured to pause data collection during periods of no movement and,
if so, how the resulting time gaps were accounted for in the data
processing. Especially, if the device firmware or manufacturer software
already imputes the time gaps that can cause significant bias to the
GGIR estimates. More generally speaking, we advise:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Disable such functionality if possible as it harms the
transparency and reproducibility since no mechanism exists to replicate
the time gaps in other accelerometer brands, and it is likely to
challenge accurate assessment of sleep and sedentary behaviour.</p></li>
<li><p>That data collected with ‘idle sleep mode’ or similar
functionalities is not referred to as raw data accelerometry, because
the data collection process has involved proprietary pre-processing
steps which violate the core principle of raw data collection.</p></li>
<li><p>Report whether ‘idle sleep mode’ or similar functionalities were
used.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="specific-note-on-actigraph-idle-sleep-mode">Specific note on ActiGraph idle sleep mode<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#specific-note-on-actigraph-idle-sleep-mode"></a>
</h3>
<p>ActiGraph files might be exported in gt3x or csv formats. When idle
sleep mode is used then the data in these files are different. In gt3x
files, time gaps can be found in the signal, with no imputation made by
the ActiLife software. However, csv files exported in ActiLife will have
imputed values in all three axes during periods of no movement. Note
that this imputation by the ActiLife software has changed at some point
in time. Initially the imputation was zeros but with more recent
versions of ActiLife the imputation uses the last recorded value for
each axis. Therefore, you need to be aware that GGIR will take care of
the time gap imputation relative to the idle sleep mode when using gt3x
files, but not when using ActiGraph csv files (because the latter come
with the time gaps already imputed).</p>

<h2 id="auto-calibration-algorithm">Auto-calibration algorithm<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#auto-calibration-algorithm"></a>
</h2>
<p>An acceleration sensor works on the principle that acceleration is
captured mechanically and converted into an electrical signal. The
relationship between the electrical signal and the acceleration is
usually assumed to be linear, involving an offset and a gain factor. We
shall refer to the establishment of the offset and gain factor as the
sensor calibration procedure. Accelerometers are usually calibrated as
part of the manufacturing process under non-movement conditions using
the local gravitational acceleration as a reference. The manufacturer
calibration can later be evaluated by holding each sensor axis parallel
(up and down) or perpendicular to the direction of gravity; readings for
each axis should be ±1 and 0 g, respectively. However, this procedure
can be cumbersome in studies with a high throughput. Furthermore, such a
calibration check will not be possible for data that have been collected
in the past and for which the corresponding accelerometer device does
not exist anymore. Techniques have been proposed that can check and
correct for calibration error based on the collected triaxial
accelerometer data in the participant’s daily life without additional
experiments, referred to as autocalibration.</p>
<p>The general principle of these techniques is that a recording of
acceleration is screened for non-movement periods. Next, the rolling
average over the nonmovement periods is taken from each of the three
orthogonal sensor axes and used to generate a three-dimensional
ellipsoid representation that should ideally be a sphere with radius 1
g. Here, deviations between the radius of the three-dimensional
ellipsoid and 1 g (ideal calibration) can then be used to derive
correction factors for sensor axis-specific calibration error. This
auto-calibration performed by GGIR uses this technique and a more
detailed description and demonstration can be found in the published <a href="https://doi.org/10.1152/japplphysiol.00421.2014" class="external-link">paper</a>.</p>
<p>The success of the auto-calibration depends on the number of
no-movement periods and variation of accelerometer orientation during
those periods available to the algorithm. As a result, auto-calibration
is expected to perform less in very short recordings (e.g., less than a
day ) or in recordings in which the participant did not wear the
accelerometer for most of the time. In such cases, you can use other
recordings from the same sensor that have more no-movement periods in a
higher variation of orientations to derive its calibration coefficients,
and then apply these coefficients to the recording of interest. To do
so, you should use the parameter <code>backup.cal.coef</code>, see
specific documentation on this parameter [here](<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/GGIR/vignettes/GGIRParameters.html#" class="external-link uri">https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/GGIR/vignettes/GGIRParameters.html#</a>:~:text=setting%20is%20TRUE.-,backup.cal.coef,-Character%20(default%20%3D%20%E2%80%9Cretrieve).</p>
<p>The auto-calibration algorithm is applied by default but can be
turned off with the parameter <code>do.cal = FALSE</code>. We do not
recommend turning off the autocalibration unless you have strong reasons
to do so.</p>

<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="non-wear-detection">Non-wear detection<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#non-wear-detection"></a>
</h2>
<p>Accelerometer non-wear time is detected on the basis of statistics
derived from a rolling time window over the raw data. A time interval is
classified as non-wear if both of the following criteria are met for at
least two out of the three accelerometer axes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The standard deviation of the accelerations is less than
accelerometer brand specific reference values, which for most brands is
13.0 m<em>g</em> (<span class="math inline">\(1 mg = 0.00981
m·s^−2\)</span>)</li>
<li>The range of accelerations (i.e., maximum value <em>minus</em>
minimum value) is less than 50 m<em>g</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The size of the rolling time window and the size of the steps it
takes in time are defined by parameter <code>windowsizes</code>, a
vector with length three. More specifically, the first value is used as
epoch size for acceleration metric calculation and not used for non-wear
detection, the second value is the resolution of the classification (
default = 15 min) and the third value is the window size use for
classification (default = 60 min) are used.</p>
<p>How it then labels the data depends on how parameter
<code>nonwear_approach</code> is specified. At the moment there are two
options: <code>nonwear_approach = "2013"</code> and
<code>nonwear_approach = "2023"</code> (default). This initial detection
and labelling of non-wear periods occurs in GGIR part 1.</p>
<div class="section level3">

<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="nonwear_approach-2013">nonwear_approach = “2013”<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#nonwear_approach-2013"></a>
</h4>
<p>The 2013 approach is a revision of an approach first described in a
<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0022922" class="external-link">2011
PLoSONE publication</a>. It applies the criteria discussed above to a
rolling 60-minute window to classify the 15 minute window in its centre
. This means that the windows overlap by 22.5 minutes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="nonwear_approach-2023">nonwear_approach = “2023”<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#nonwear_approach-2023"></a>
</h4>
<p>The 2023 version of the algorithm uses the criteria applied to the
60-minute window to assign a non-wear score to that entire window.
Instead of centring the 60 minute window in the middle of the 15 minute
window, the 60 minute window’s left edge is aligned to the left edge of
the 15 minute window. As a result, each 15-minute window is classified
multiple times given that multiple steps of the rolling window
classification will overlap with it. If the non-wear criteria are met
for any of these windows that overlap with the 15-minute window, it will
be labelled as non-wear.</p>

</h3>
<p>Inspection of non-wear classifications indicated that the algorithm
as described above does not cope well with periods of monitor
transportation per post. Here, long periods of non-wear are briefly
interrupted by periods of movement, which are interpreted by the
algorithm as monitor wear. Therefore, in GGIR part 2, the detected
non-wear from part 1 is screened for implausible wear periods which are
then relabelled as non-wear. All detected wear-periods of less than six
hours and less than 30% of the combined duration of their bordering
non-wear periods ar e relabelled as non-wear. Additionally, all
wear-periods of less than three hours and which form less than 80% of
their bordering non-wear periods are classified as non-wear. The
motivation for selecting a relatively high criterion (&lt; 30%) in
combination with a long period (6 hrs) and a low criterion (&lt; 80%) in
combination with a short period (3 hrs) is that long periods are more
likely to be actually related to monitor wear time. To illustrate the
algorithm we created a visual model, see picture below. Here, units of
time are presented in squares and marked grey if detected as non-wear
time. Period C is detected as wear-time and borders to non-wear periods
B and D. If the length of C is less than six hours and C divided by the
sum of B and D is less than 0.3 then the first criteria is met and block
C is turned into a non-wear period.</p>
<p><img src="nonwearimage.jpg" width="400px"></p>
<p>Visual inspection of &gt;100 traces from a large observational study
revealed that applying this stage three times iteratively allowed for
improved classification of periods characterised by intermittent periods
of non-wear and apparent wear.</p>

</h3>
<p>The final 24 hours are often considered the period in which the
accelerometer is potentially taken off but moved because of
transportation, e.g., by the mail service. All wear-periods in the final
24 hrs of each measurement shorter than three hours and preceded by at
least one hour of non-wear time are classified as non-wear.</p>
<p>Finally, if the measurement starts or ends with a period of less than
three hours of wear followed or preceded by non-wear (any length) then
this period of wear is classified as non-wear. These additional criteria
for screening the beginning and end of the accelerometer file reflect
the likelihood of movements that are involved when starting the
accelerometer or downloading the data from the accelerometer. This final
check can be turned off with parameter
<code>nonWearEdgeCorrection</code>, which may be relevant when
processing accelerometer data collected during single night
polysomnography studies.</p>

<h2 id="clipping-detection">Clipping detection<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#clipping-detection"></a>
</h2>
<p>GGIR part 1 also screens the acceleration signal for “clipping”,
i.e., sustained unusual high (raw) acceleration values non compatible
with human movement. If more than 30% of the data points in a 15-minute
window (same as used for non-wear) are close to the maximal values
(technical term for this is dynamic range) of this sensor the
corresponding time period is considered as potentially unreliable, which
may be explained by the sensor getting stuck at its extreme value or
accelerometers being used inappropriately (attached to some heavily
accelerating object). For example, for a dynamic range of 8<em>g</em>,
accelerations over 7.5<em>g</em> would be marked as “clipping”. The
window is also classified as clipping if any value in the window is
larger than 150% the dynamic range of the sensor. Given that clipping
rarely happens it is reported by GGIR as part of non-wear time. They are
treated the same and by merging them we arrive at a single indicator for
the amount of valid data. However, to keep track of the occurrence of
clipping time GGIR does report the fraction of 15-minute windows during
which clipping occurs, see section on output below.</p>
